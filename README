archived old attempt at a website design, around a year old from 
now, originally on sr.ht. 

leaving it as it, as an educational experience.

what it did well:
	- choice of typography is nice, but i might be biased.
	- disclaimers are stylized while retaining an accessible look
	- semantic HTML5 elements used
	
	
what it didn't do well:
	- background is too exggadurated. i know what i was going for
	  back then and i can now tell it was not a great idea.
	  (admittedly, @prefers-reduced-motion deals with it. but
	  still not a great design in general.)
	- design in general was too bland and tried too hard.
